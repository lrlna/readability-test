# Readability Tests

This is an upcoming module that is meant to help with figuring out a level of readability of a given paragraph. It follows two specific [formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests):

- Flesch Reading Ease - gives an index to a given paragraph based on readability.
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade level - gives a US grade level as a result, or number of years of education necessary to read a given paragraph.
